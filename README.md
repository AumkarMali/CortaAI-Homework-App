# Homework Helper App | Goal of this project...

Many applications available on the Android Store are designed to assist students with a variety of problems across different categories. The goal of CortaAI was not only to facilitate my entry into the app development ecosystem but also to create an application capable of addressing virtually any problem effectively. This was achieved by using various technologies that are already optimized for specific subjects.

#### Program Explanation

#### GUI

A minimalistic and user-friendly interface was designed using the Kivy UI framework. It features a text input field for users to enter their queries, and a microphone icon and an instructional label prompting users to "Enter text to start...". The interface includes two buttons: a "Submit" button to send the user's input to the AI and a "Clear" button to reset the input and output fields. The design emphasizes a clean aesthetic with a blue-gray theme and includes a logo image at the top for branding. Responses from the AI are displayed in a flat button format, enhancing readability while ensuring a smooth user experience.
